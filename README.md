#Github freaking out on me. If you get the chance add <li><a href="contacts.html">Contact Us</a></li> to attributions, geometry, and databases.html.

#Todo in any order
  - Freeze time when project/row is added (may not be possible in current state)
  - Add samples
  - Figure out how to import shapefiles and interact with stored data
  - Make it so we can run the web page through github, allowing us to link actual webpage and not files
  - Probably more stuff
